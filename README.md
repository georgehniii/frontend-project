# frontend-project
My front end project. Its a weather app.
You can check it out at this link: https://georgehniii-rain-crow.netlify.app/
The radar section is a work in progress. It currently dosnt use an actual radar but does use weather information to give you an idea of how the weather is. The map may not load yet. Will get back to it soon.
