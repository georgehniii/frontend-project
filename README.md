If the map is not working try to minimize your screen and then expand it back it will resize the map this is the temperary work around for now. If it still does not work then to many people have used the app and locked the API key. I will be working on limiting the request calls so that it will work again after a minute or two if it is exceeded.

My front end project. Its a weather app.

You can check it out at this link: https://georgehniii-rain-crow.netlify.app/

The radar section is a work in progress. It currently dosnt use an actual radar but does use weather information to give you an idea of how the weather is. The map may not load yet. Will get back to it soon.

Will be updating the code to ES6 in future and cleaning it up even more.
